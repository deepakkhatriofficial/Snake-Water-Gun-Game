# Snake-Water-Gun Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic "Snake-Water-Gun" game, where the user plays against the computer.


## How to Play
- The user chooses one of the three options:
  - `s` for Snake
  - `w` for Water
  - `g` for Gun
- The computer randomly selects an option.
- The winner is determined based on the following rules:
  - Snake (s) beats Water (w)
  - Water (w) beats Gun (g)
  - Gun (g) beats Snake (s)
  - If both the user and computer choose the same option, it's a draw.

2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
4. Run the game using:
